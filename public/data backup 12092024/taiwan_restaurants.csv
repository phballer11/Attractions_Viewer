Reservations are a must, either made online or by phone. Upon arrival, guests are warmly welcomed at the reception desk on the first floor of Taipei 101 and promptly escorted to their reserved table by the attentive wait staff.\n\nArriving at 2:45pm during lunch hour, our brief wait for the wait staff to escort us to our reserved table lasted approximately 5-10 minutes, ensuring a smooth entry process. The restaurant's unique circular seating arrangement, positioned near the expansive glass windows, affords diners uninterrupted views of Taipei's skyline. Additionally, the circular layout of the food stations simplifies navigation, allowing guests to explore the diverse culinary offerings effortlessly.\n\nThe buffet presents an impressive array of dishes, showcasing a fusion of international cuisines to cater to diverse dietary preferences. Standout highlights include the tantalizing fire-grilled sushi, succulent freshly grilled steaks and pork ribs, and an assortment of meticulously crafted artisanal coffee and cocktails. Noteworthy is the chef's personalized attention at the steak and pork rib station, where each dish is expertly plated in French style, elevating the dining experience.\n\nReflecting on the meal, while the price-performance ratio may not be the highest due to the absence of standout premium ingredients, the buffet's emphasis on luxury dining justifies its price point. It remains a worthwhile culinary journey, particularly for discerning travelers seeking an indulgent experience in Taiwan. Priced at over 4,000 NTD per person, the restaurant's commitment to menu uniqueness and ingredient quality shines through.\n\nA thoughtful touch is the provision of postcards at each table, allowing guests to pen their sentiments on the spot and deposit them in a special mailbox. We were pleasantly surprised to receive our postcard a month later at our address in Madrid, Spain, a testament to the restaurant's dedication to guest satisfaction and attention to detail. Overall, the buffet at Taipei 101 offers an unforgettable dining experience that seamlessly blends luxury, gastronomy, and breathtaking views."",""My recent visit to A Joy in Taipei offered a mix of exceptional and disappointing experiences. The food and the view of Taipei 101 were undoubtedly the highlights of the day, justifying the high price of 3680 TWD per person. The dishes were creatively crafted, combining fresh ingredients with innovative culinary techniques, and the stunning view of the city skyline added a special charm to the meal.\n\nHowever, the service and facilities fell short of expectations. Firstly, while I was in the restroom, my friend was rushed to pay the bill twice within a span of less than 10 minutes, despite having informed the staff that I would be handling the payment. This created an uncomfortable and rushed dining experience, which was not in line with the standard expected at such a premium establishment.\n\nSecondly, the restroom facilities were inadequate. With only three stalls available in the men's restroom, I had to wait for an extended period of time. Surprisingly, one of the stalls was occupied by a staff member, raising concerns about staff using the same facilities during work hours, especially when customer demand is high. For a high-end buffet charging over 3000 TWD, the restroom facilities were not only insufficient but also paled in comparison to much less expensive establishments.\n\nIn summary, while A Joy excels in culinary expertise and offers a mesmerizing view, the service approach and restroom facilities significantly dampened the overall experience. I hope this feedback helps in improving these aspects for future diners."",""Went here with my mom and my sis. We all came back from living overseas (Europe and US), so my review might be different~\nAnyways, do I want to spend 5000 TWD on a buffet?? Maybe not? But this seems like a popular thing in Taiwan? Usually when I spend this kind of money, it's more for a nice restaurant ambiance! Anyways. Moving on...\n\nLots of food options but majority of the people were of course aiming for fresh seafood. We had quite a bit of sushi, sashimi and hand rolls, not bad. But again, we had to queue... So again, is this the experience you want?! I'm not sure.\n\nYou can see from my photos the ambiance is nice, view is great so id say it's nice to go there for the experience. Food wise, for me personally, western food is ok, I personally go for more local taiwanese cuisines but then again you can get them anywhere as well.\n\nI will say that they did care about little details like plating~ a few more unusual buffet items you wouldn't get in Taiwan (some salads). Desserts were very good, the teas and coffees options were also good. Pleasantly surprised they had fresh honeycomb \uD83D\uDC4D\uD83D\uDE01\n\nSo my overall review is go for the experience and the view. =)"",""Amazing! Just amazing! All the tables at the booking time were seated together and were given 2.5 hours for the buffet. The food was too notched and there were so many options I wish I could have tried everything. They also provide some small entertainment which was an added bonus. The service was amazing and all the staff were extremely professional. If I get to travel taipei again, I'll definitely come back!"",""On the 86th floor of the Taipei 101, A Joy Restaurant is a buffet that truly lives up to its lofty location. While the price may be steep, the experience is undeniably worth every penny. The buffet was superb, better than some of those I’ve had in Vegas. I'm already eagerly searching for any excuse to come back."",""The view is amazing since it’s high above\nTons of options to choose from\nThe lobsters, oysters, and abalones are really good and high class\n\nThe buffs was really expensive (4000up)\nIt really is one of the most high class buffets in Taiwan but I would personally say it’s a bit overpriced tho"",""Had dinner last night. Food was not bad but considering the price it wasn’t amazing. The crab was salty, the oyster wasn’t really sweet, the sushi was nice, nothing tasted bad but nothing really wowed us.

It's tasty and varied, although you can't expect any dish to stand out like in a specialized restaurant--it's a buffet, after all. However, the experience is well worth it for the stunning views …"",""Although very pricy, we had 3 and half hours to enjoy many amazing dishes that no other buffet restaurants would offer all in one place. The service staff are very polite and attentive. Would love to visit again when we are back in Taipei."",""Simply an amazing experience with an extreme view overlooking Taipei City, from the 86th floor in Taipei Tower 101.
