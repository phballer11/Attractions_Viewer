So much that my friend and I ate there 3 times in 4 days! The souffl\u00E9 pancakes here were much better than the happy pancakes place, in my opinion.\n\nMy friend and I tried different dishes from here. All the pancakes and French toast dishes were had were fantastic. The burger and grilled chicken sandwich were also amazing. I also tried the Tom yum soup with noodles and that was light and comforting. We didn\u2019t like the garlic shrimp pasta very much.\n\nAvocado salad was great. Also enjoyed the buttermilk fried chicken! The mango lassi was my favorite drink here: slightly different from the regular lassi from Indian restaurants but it was still good.\n\nOverall, I enjoyed coming here and can\u2019t wait to be back when next I\u2019m in Tokyo.\n\nThere was a line every time we went but it moved fast! Amazing service too; very nice waiters and they made slight adjustments to my dishes when I asked. Food was also very affordable."",""***how to find!***\nGoogle maps is really bad at telling you how to find this place! You need to go into the electronics store and find the elevator to the 8th floor!\n\nVery good restaurant! Really nice ambiance, and great decor. The staff is really nice, and the middle long table is great for meeting people!\n\nI had the eggs Benedict with a Chiffon Cake! The eggs were really fresh, and tasted home made! The sauces used were really tasty, and the presentation was amazing! My only complaint was a bit too much salt on the fries.\n\nThe chiffon cake was extremely soft and sweet! Everything about the bakeries in this place is super top notch! I hope to visit again!"",""Great portion of food for an affordable price. So much variety of sweets and teas. Very nice to eat for lunch for just have a snack.\n\nGot the sister dish that had both hot cakes and French toast. The French toast was amazing!\n\nHowever, the hot cakes were very eggy and not my style. They were indeed fluffy but I would go back only for the French toast even though it seems like the hot cakes are their selling point.\n\nService was fast and English friendly. In a very busy area in a busy mall but worthwhile if not a long wait. Luckily, no wait when I went on Friday lunchtime.\n\nRecommend if in the area!"",""Popping in looking for French toast and we were not let down with it. The wait is long for it since it is baked and prepared fresh but the flavor is great. The Eggs Benedict was also good on flavor the picture from the online menu do not depict much American cheese on then I didn\u2019t notice any on the photos and I don\u2019t generally have cheese all over mine the flavor was still good but would skip that item next time. The grapefruit juice as well is one of my favorites and always order it when it\u2019s at restaurant and isn\u2019t as common these days."",""Good food and portions for the price. The service was okay. The place seems to fill up very quickly. However, the entire restaurant felt like it needed a face lift. As the tables and chairs were at the end of their life cycle. The floors and walls were dirty too covered in sauce stains and scraps it seems. Obviously this place is popular with tourists and accessible, so I can\u0027t knock it too hard, but this rating is definitely closer to a 3 than a 4."",""Was so good we came here twice. Had the Eggs Benedict followed by the Macadamia Pancakes because I just couldn\u2019t make up my mind. Both were delicious. Husband had the same but with the Creme Br\u00FBl\u00E9e pancakes and they were ok\n\nTried the Beef Pho when we came back the second time and it was better than the pho I had at other places although I could have done with more rice noodles. Plenty of veggies and herbs in there though."",""I went in the morning and there was a 1 hour\u002B wait, I came back at night and there was no wait! I ordered the original french toast, pancakes, and garlic shrimp pasta. The French toast portion is a bit small, but tasted better than the pancakes as the pancakes tasted too buttery even when I didn\u2019t add any butter. I liked the garlic shrimp pasta the most."",""Without a doubt this is a place I\u0027d recommend people to stop by if they\u0027re hungry and in need of either something sweet or savory. I have had the pleasure of trying different items on the menu and each time I\u0027ve enjoyed them to the fullest. I love the flavor that you can taste in each cup of coffee which fits perfectly with the meal."",""Good pancakes but was little eggy taste\nThe french toast was good but dense not fluffy\nThe waiter wasn\u2019t welcoming\nFirst time in japan felt that way\nAlthough there was empty tables but he told us to wait for 15-20 min to sit at the empty table."",""There was a queue at around 1:30pm when we dined but it moved relatively quickly.

The slightly unusual dishes, such as bamboo shoot namul and cherry tomato kimchi, are delicious.\n\n\u0060\u0060Hiraku Salad\u0027\u0027 is simple, but the dressing is delicious. I want to eat meat while picking to cleanse my palate, so I\u0027d be happy if there was a little more.\n\nNow it\u0027s time for the meat! This one, named \u0060\u0060meat appetizer,\u0027\u0027 is a large piece of beef sashimi with a heaping amount of yukhoe covered in sweet sauce in the center. An outrageous act of eating yukhoe mixed with egg yolk wrapped in beef sashimi!

The meat melts in your mouth.\n\nThe \u0060\u0060Assortment of 4 types of carefully selected meat\u0027\u0027 includes tomosankaku, rump, chili pepper, and shoulder loin, ranging from lean meat to marbled meat. When you eat these with salt, it brings out the flavor of the meat, allowing you to enjoy the flavor of the red meat and fat.\n\nWhite rice here. The rice is also cooked in a clay pot, so it\u0027s fluffy and juicy. Shiny and sweet.\n\nI was asked to grill the \u0022thick-sliced \u200B\u200Bspecial liver\u0022 properly (in Ostrich Club style), so I wondered if the liver was ever so soft, fluffy, and delicious.\n\nThe \u0060\u0060Large-sized Specially Selected Misuji Sukiyaki\u0027\u0027 is also grilled by the staff in front of you, mixed with orange egg yolk, and served with rice cooked in a clay pot for a truly delicious meal.\n\nThe last dish is \u0060\u0060Kiwami Ichibo and Tokusho Harami.\u0027\u0027 This is sauce-based, and there are two types: lean meat and marbled meat, so it\u0027s nice to be able to compare the deliciousness of the meat while eating it. As an old man, I don\u0027t like greasy foods anymore, so I guess I prefer skirt steak. I want to keep carbohydrates to a minimum at night, but I always end up eating white rice!\n\nTo finish off your meal, choose a dessert from \u0060\u0060rich pudding,\u0027\u0027 \u0060\u0060cr\u00E8me br\u00FBl\u00E9e,\u0027\u0027 or \u0060\u0060warabi mochi (or so I think?)\u0027\u0027.

This bliss is then interrupted by the realisation of another dimension to the puff with its crispy cookie shell that adds just the right amount of crisp to the soft custard and firm pastry.\n\nThe vanilla is most popular but I preferred the chocolate version which was just perfectly sweetened with a slight bitter after note that is just divine in how balanced it is.

The quality and seasoning of sushi is extraordinarily amazing, and with most seats facing the chef making sushi, it has no differences even compared to many omakase experiences.\n\nHave visited twice and each time we enjoyed every bite of it. I\u2019m a fan of shrimps and scallops while my girlfriend loves salmon belly and chu-toro. We are both satisfied for what we are offered over the counter! Incredibly fresh and tasty, it gives us taste beyond all previous impressions. I will strongly recommend \u8D64\u3048\u3073\u3001\u30DB\u30BF\u30C6\u3001\u8ECA\u3048\u3073 which are definitely fascinating. Not gonna lie but we actually took 50 dishes, gonna cancel our eating plans for the next 24 hours lolllll.\n\nI\u2019d also like to recommend the Chef\u2019s choice three pieces. It costs only \u00A51300 but serves as a delicious mystery box which you would not know until dish is in front of you. It\u2019s a good choice to try those you wouldn\u2019t risk to directly order, but will eventually broaden your choices. The two of us ordered 5 times of this mystery box, and it came out fascinating every single time.\n\nThe best time to come is from before it opens to 12:30 on weekdays, when there will not be a waiting line. Going for a dinner might be risky as the line is long and would take extra long time. It does offer the choice to notify through phone calls but not sure if foreign phone numbers would work."",""We were craving sushi while shopping around Omotesando/Aoyama, so we decided to swing by. The line was out the door, so we hopped onto the virtual queue. We finally got seated after waiting nearly an hour, but it was totally worth it. We got seated in a back room away from the main dining hall, so it was more private and omakase style, instead of the conveyor belt sushi we were hoping for. Despite that, the sushi prepared was extremely fresh and high quality, and the menu had a large and varied selection. Halfway through our seating, one of the chefs carried in a whole amberjack fish on his shoulder. All diners at the time had the option to guess its weight, and the closest ones were able to get a free sushi of fresh amberjack. We got lucky and were rewarded 1 piece each.\n\nReally had a great experience, and would highly recommend if you\u2019re looking for a solid sushi spot. However, minus 1 star for the excessive wait time and slightly disordered queuing guidelines and process"",""Social media hype. This got to be the worse sushi I\u0027ve ever had at any price range. The fish has so much tendon, I felt like I was chewing on a plastic bag. Rice was not cooked also. Everything felt extremely not fresh. I had better fish from local supermarkets. The seating was not comfortable and very cramped. Most customers were foreigners. All I see ppl busy posting on instagram. Save yourself some money and go to any local sushi restaurant and you\u0027ll have better quality food at the lower price and more comfortable atmosphere."",""Extremely fresh seafood and tasty sushi served in Tokyo. This sushi restaurant was known for the Michelin Star which was given to the Ginza shop and it is very well known by the locals. In addition I would suggest that english translation be provided as I cannot understand what the chef was talking about when he was talking on the mic."",""Freshly sliced if you\u2019re having the raw stuff, great variety and efficient service. The place is able to cater to both sashimi and non sashimi eaters. I enjoyed myself even with my pickle sushis, chawanmushi, tempura scallop and karaage while my partner enjoyed himself with the variety of fish, squid, prawns etc."",""We only waited for 15mins for line up during lunch time. It\u2019s a very nice experience sitting in front of the chief and watching her making sushi that I just placed. They were more tasty than Midori ones. The private room dinning is a bit pricey than the ones in the public area."",""Great sushi place ! My daughter recommended this sushi place for its freshness. It belongs to the same group that provides omakase dinner. We enjoyed our lunch as the food was excellent (sushi was full of freshness!), service was great and \u2026"",""Just a stone\u0027s throw from Omote-Sando Station (or a short walk from Harajuku Station), Kaiten Sushi Ginza Onodera is a fancy/upscale conveyor belt sushi establishment.

We found Onodera Namiki Dori after some research. It\u0027s the newer of two branches in Ginza. Located on the 6th floor of an unassuming building, once you go in, you\u0027re greeted with a very high end traditional Japanese setting. It\u0027s a small venue that can maybe sit max 10 to 12 customers.\n\nWe opted for dinner which is an omakase course. We also booked early (they open at 6pm for dinner service) and were very lucky to have the restaurant to ourselves for the first hour before the next guest arrived. This made it a truly memorable experience for us.\n\nSuzuki-san, the head chef, was an absolute delight, taking the time to explain each dish and engage in small talk while effortlessly preparing and making each dish.\n\nThe quality and execution of each was immaculate. Even though many of the dishes were deep fried, we didn\u0027t feel as heavy by the end as one would think.\n\nWould highly recommend this restaurant if you\u0027re looking for high end tempura. Yes, it\u0027s pricey but worth the experience as you\u0027ll walk out having tried the best possible versions of tempura classics like prawn, mushrooms, eggplant but will have also tried tempura you\u0027d likely never have before, ranging from unique fishes we had never had before to uni being wrapped in shiso and fried.\n\nYou\u0027ll need to book in advance and can do so online. Suzuki-san and his team all speak some English, which is great.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that the last dish before dessert was a true highlight, you get to pick how you want your kakiage. Believe there were 4 or 5 choices ranging from having it as a rice set to being set on top of soba noodles. We opted for ochazuke (rice with a tea-based dashi broth) which was sublime!"",""Had an absolutely wonderful experience here. I recommend making reservations due to limited seating and timeslots.\n\nManager and Sommelier Yuki Inoue was very friendly and informative (Spoke English). He helped suggest a few sake pairings that went well with the tempura omakase lineup.\n\nExecutive Chef Yuya Uchi and his team were exceptionally coordinated and did an excellent job delivering delicious tempura and informing us on how it should be eaten. The food was exceptional. The batter was light, hot, and crispy. The ingredients were fresh or prepared with care.\n\nMy wife and I could\u0027ve kept to ourselves, and dinner would\u0027ve been great, but we chose to engage with the staff, and our experience here was elevated. I would suggest that you also choose to engage with wonder and an open mind.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a fantastic and unique experience!"",""Wonderful dining experience with incredible tempura. The staff and chef were so friendly with my wife and our 3 children and they all had an incredible experience. We would recommend this to anyone coming to Tokyo. The tofu tempura and mushroom tempura were favorites. Thank you again!"",""Definitely one of the best tempura place in town.

To be honest, I hardly find any good restaurant in KL that serves good unagi due to the fact that most of them use local variety that has muddy taste in it. Since I was heading to Shibuya one evening, I found one in Unagi Toku located in the famous Shibuya Hikarie building, a few minutes walk from the Shibuya station.\n\nIt was still quite early for dinner so the restaurant was quite empty. Famis\n\nI had to say that so far this is the best unagi I\u0027d tasted in my life (read my life.. not yours). Famished but didn\u0027t want to stuff our stomach too much, we settled for one of their signature dishes and one basic dish.\n\u25FEUnagi Chazuke Tokujyou - costing 5200 yen, this set was meticulously prepared and beautifully presented in front of us. The grilled unagi was served together with the rice in wooden bucket. The instructions clearly stated that to enjoy the dish we must (1) taste the original taste of unagi first; (2) pair the unagi with shallot and wasabi, and lastly (3) pour the homemade tea into the rice bowl containing the unagi, shallot and wasabi and eat it Ochazuke style.\n\u25FEShirayaki Gohan - simple lightly grilled unagi on rice with Japanese pickles and soup. Oh my god I simply love this as I could definitely taste the original flavour of the unagi without any marinade or flavouring. Just dip the unagi into their soy sauce and eat just like that.\n\nThe unagi was very tender and the sauce (from the set) tasted just right - not too sweet nor salty - price-wise just remember that this is Tokyo. Another food checked from my list."",""Not the best hitsumabushi but definitely not the worst either (I\u0027m a bit biased with Nagoya style of unagi). Keep in mind that it\u0027s on the expensive side. What I enjoyed here was the fluffy and juicy umaki (eel rolled omelette). Ambiance is good and service was exceptional. I will still come and dine here for the umaki and probably try other stuff on their menu.\n\nFoodibear gives Unagi Toku a decent 4/5."",""No waiting time. Staff was friendly and approachable. They\u2019re used to tourists. So information on how to eat the Unagi comes in English, Chinese, Korean and French. Unagi was really soft and well worth its money! Can be abit boney for some, but the trick is to eat the Unagi in small bites. Worth its money for its quality!"",""Great unagi sets at a decent price! The best was the unagi chazuke set. This place takes a while to prepare the food, but it\u2019s because they prepare everything almost from scratch, so you might end up waiting 30-40 minutes to get your food. \u2026"",""Feels very bony compared to other places, not sure if this is because it wasn\u0027t grilled properly. Tasted pretty average, with the sauce on the lighter side. Quite expensive and the portion wasn\u0027t that big."",""A nice lunch after walking all morning. Unagi is tasty and soft.

Since it\u0027s on the 7th floor of a building, that wasn\u0027t a surprise.\n\nFrom what I can see, the restaurant is pretty small; full capacity is at probably around 20-25 people. There was about 4-6 wait staff. So plenty of people to help out. -- yet our tea was only filled once during the whole meal. Considering we paid over 8500 yen for 3 set dinner meals, in addition to the fact that most of the time the staff was just loitering around (again, not full).\n\nThe meal I had was the set meal with a bento box, 2 pieces of ungai, soup, steamed egg with unagi, and some sides \u002B random salad. -- 3250 yen. --- the portions were regular Japanese meal portions; but what made me bitter is the fact that I can easily tell, that, the unagi in my bento was significantly smaller than the one for the customer next to me. No, it wasn\u0027t just \u0027cause in their bento they ordered a 4 piece one. But I literally could see, one piece of theirs = 50% bigger and thicker than mine. And my meal wasn\u0027t even a cheap meal!\n\nIt\u0027s not fair. The sizes should be similar.\n\nBut, redeeming points: they do taste fresh, it\u0027s nothing like the microwave frozen ones. Though I cannot say for certain that the TOKU ones taste /BETTER/. It did taste fresh and different. It is well cooked, seasoned, and flavoured. The white rice is of good quality. The atmosphere was also pretty good, ideal place for a date or even dine alone. You can see where the unagi is cooked and grilled; the whole process while the chief is working on it.\n\nOther than the poor cost/portion value ratio; and the disparity in the amount of unagi that\u0027s served (even the cheaper bento of my parents, they had bigger ones too)... and slow service; everything else is fine.\n\nThough I would not go again."",""I had lunch here today, the eel quality here is really bad with LOTS OF FISH BONES. It is super unusual. There is a fish bone stuck in my throat at the moment and I will need to visit the hospital tomorrow and see if it can be removed.\nKindly suggest ppl to avoid this restaurant and find a better place for eel."",""I have walked for quite a long time in Gion district, Kyoto to find a Unagi restaurant. Finally, i decided to have it here. Price is quite moderate to high, but still acceptable coz in the department store. Unagi size is okay in price 2,900 yen something. It is tasty.

Despite that, the shrimp fries were thin, the tonkatsu batter peeled off...I was expecting rice, but there was almost no flavor...which was quite disappointing. The only thing that was delicious was the nameko soup with red soup stock. If I\u0027m going to pay 2,300 yen for this, I wonder if I\u0027ll eat something else in Ginza. Although it\u0027s in the neighborhood, I probably won\u0027t visit again."",""I was here at lunchtime on Tuesday, they were swapped but staffs still kept smiling with great attitude. As their recommendation, I ordered something called \u2018tokujo katsudon\u2019 (the biggest one). I also got salad and pickles for free when I waited for my main food, it was all good thou. Btw, I was surprised when i got that katsudon. Firstly, a bowl was so big, its pattern looks like the traditional thing of Japan, it impressed me. And that food was so delicious, pieces look a bit thick, but fr, it\u2019s easy to bite because of its tender, I wished I asked for more rice or they would have a bigger meat size to choose. Then, I got hot tea when I finished my meal. Restaurant\u2019s atmosphere was fresh and the design was pretty too. My day was so perfect thank for Katsukichi, I\u2019ll come with my friends and family the next time. High recommendation !!!!!!!!!"",""Available for lunch on weekdays. There was a line around 12:00, but it was empty as it was around 1:30pm. It\u0027s a bit slow, but it takes about 15 to 20 minutes for the food to arrive.\nOrdered the loin cutlet set meal. It might be rude to say that it was worth the price, but it was very delicious.\nI changed the cabbage!\nApparently they have chilled katsudon in the summer, so I\u0027d like to try the chilled katsudon next time.\n\nat a later date\nAdded a photo of chilled katsudon.\nIt was a refreshing bowl of Japanese ginger, plums, and perilla that was perfect for the hot summer!"",""We were not impressed by the food or the atmosphere. The service was good.\n\nThe pork was dry and overcooked. The rice was also dry; the soup had no flavor. We had a combo plate and our favorite thing on the plate was the pumpkin and the crab croquette.\n\nWe came for dinner on a Wednesday evening, and we were 1 of 3 tables occupied in the restaurant. The restaurant does not have a good atmosphere.\n\nWe would not recommend this place and we wouldn\u2019t return."",""Available for lunch on weekdays.\nOn this day, I will eat 150g of pork cutlet set meal. 2300 yen too.\nConsidering the location, the price is pretty good.\nSatisfaction level is a little low considering the price.\nRefills are available for rice, cabbage, and miso soup.\nIs the cabbage cut too thin? Feels a little dry.\nThe waiting time from being seated to being served is also relatively long.\nThe taste of pork itself is not bad."",""A favorite lunchtime restaurant of Japanese businessmen. The filet cutlets are exquisite! The fried oysters, a limited-time menu item from fall to spring, is a must-try. Free refills of rice. The hot jasmine tea after lunch is the best."",""Very good quality Tonkatsu. (even though a bit pricy)\nJust try to order bigger Tonkatsu rather than small cheaper one, which enable you to savor the true Tonkatsu flavor."",""Excellent and delicious Katsu lunch.

The bread and cheese tasted so good; the bread texture was \u0022mochi-mochi,\u0022 I am pretty sure they are using premium bread, and the cheese was also decent. They add one stick of basil, so we can sprinkle it on our own, as much as we want. It was delicious and fulfilling compared to another brunch; I was not hungry until the evening.\n\nI am a big caf\u00E9 latte fan, so I ordered a caf\u00E9 latte, and my friend ordered a matcha latte. The drinks are very aesthetic; and for the taste, it tastes the same as other coffee.\nOnly cold drinks are available for this type of drink because the staff said they need ice cube to make the gradation.\n\nI ordered a long millefeuille Easter edition for dessert because it was adorable!! But this type of food takes much work to eat. Once you cut the pie, the crumble is scattered everywhere, and the taste is not what I expected.\n\nPrepare your card because they do not accept cash, and be patient because this place is so famous that you must line up.

Their signage is practically nonexistent.\n\nThat aside, we stumbled into this place while searching for brunch the other day and, after some apprehension caused by climbing an old, nondescript stairway to open a blank door, were greeted by a cozy, busy, and very lively grill, with bar seating and a few tables. The place is tight, but the lack of signage seems to leave a few spots open for opportunistic eaters.\n\nWhat can I say about the menu, but that it\u0027s fun? The dishes are unique and interesting (if predictably Japanese-brunch; see thick toast and uncrisped bacon) with clear thought put into the presentation. The food was fantastic, and it was a pleasure to watch the cooks working away at the grill on the other side of the bar.\n\nAll in all, I\u0027m glad I found this place, especially since it seems to do all it can to hide, and I will be returning."",""No store sign outside of the building so it took awhile to find. The cafe entrance is on the the 2nd floor, no sign either. The interior is not spacious but comfortable and beautifully design. You will be asked to look at the menu online and they will take your order and pay at at the corner of the cafe, not at your table once you decide what you want. I think that might be due to the space being tight.\n\nThe overall presentation of the food is nicely done with beautiful color, two different kinds of hard boiled eggs served in egg holders, coffee served in a tall wine style glass gives a nice sophisticated touch. Food tasted good too. White toast is the base for meal and deserts."",""Amazing little open kitchen feel with bar seating (in front of kitchen) or communal table.  Can\u2019t make reservations but I went in on a Sunday morning and waited no more than 5 min.  The food was artisanal and the drinks are very nicely made.

Also, they only take cash."",""I\u2019ve walked past this place a ton of times and wondered why it was so popular. The reviews are plentiful, but kinda all over the place.

The broth was rich and flavorful, and the vegetables were almost cooked to perfection. I especially enjoyed the daikon radish, asparagus, broccoli, fresh tomatoes, and mizuna greens. The noodles had a great al dente texture, and the garlic added a nice kick of flavor. While there was a slight burn on some of the asparagus, overall, this was a delicious and healthy meal.\n\nThe service was friendly and courteous.

Afuri is the first ramen shop in Japan that wanted to create a nice ramen experience for women. Most of the regular ramen shops in Japan are usually packed with salarymen slurping their noodles, but Afuri changed all that and now has many locations in Tokyo. I like the shio ramen best -- the broth is very light and smooth. The chashu is also very tasty since it\u0027s flamed grilled. The noodles are thin, but you can order thicker noodles instead. The atmosphere is very chic and comfortable. I\u0027ve visited the Naka-Meguro and Ebisu locations and they\u0027re both within walking distance from the train. Note: Cash is not accepted, only cards (including IC cards). If you are looking for tonkosu ramen, then Afuri is not for you -- that\u0027s the one type I wish they served, but you can\u0027t go wrong with other offerings.

It\u2019s a popular ramen restaurant. The good thing is that it doesn\u2019t take a lunch break, and opens till 11 pm. You can come at a quiet time to avoid crowds."",""A hip place with vending machine ordering. We tried the tsukemen here and it was very good. I ordered a chicken cold tsukemen.

The spicy broth was perfectly complemented by the sourish yuzu flavour.\n\nIf you want to try spicy ramen other than the usual shio ramen (salt ramen), shoyu ramen (soy sauce ramen), or miso ramen (fermented bean paste ramen), wakayama ramen, ramyeon ramen, tonkotsu ramen, then Afuri Spicy ramen will be  your choice."",""After 2 weeks in Japan I was really craving for spicy food.\n\nMy friend recommended Afuri and it was not dissapoint!\n\nI chosed spicy level 8 and it was enough. I think more than this level would be no more other Flavour.\n\nThe tangy and spicy went well together. The service is good, Efficient and fast.\n\nThe original yuzu one also very very good. All the topping were amazing from the tender chicken slices to the pork.\n\nYuzu lassi was life saver after the level 8 spicy ramen.\n\nIf you are a bit sick of rich pork broth ramen and want something fresh (and spicy) to reset your palate. This is the go to ramen store for sure.\n\nI would visit them again if I try this store early during the trip."",""Spicy noodle/ramen shop with spicy level from 1-8, then 28!  I tried the level 8, spicy but can go higher, not sure if I can do level 28, likely not enjoyable.  The broth has the Chinese numbing spice which I didn\u2019t like too much.  Otherwise the noodle and meat were done well, and broth was tasty.  Price was a bit on the pricy side but still reasonable."",""Delicious tsukemen. Chewy thick noodles. The dipping soup is mildly spicy, flavorful, and rich as I prefer. They have different level of spiciness to choose as well. They also have choices between chicken and pork, so I chose chicken this time. The meat is so soft. And not to mention staff is friendly and welcoming. Highly recommended."",""Tried level 28 spicy Yuzu Kara Kurenai Ramen (hells fire). Be warned, it truly is spicy, but also delicious. Yuzu flavour was still present despite the heat, the egg was gorgeous, and the braised pork belly was delicious. The level 28 ramen comes with some kind of stomach ache relief medicine."",""Very interesting ramen besides the traditional style.

The Michelin dish is Special porcini shio (salt) ramen (\u00A52000) so I ordered this one. The ramen came with duck, chicken, pork, wonton, and soft boiled egg with little spoon of truffle. The chicken and pork are very tender and duck is very flavorful. There is grated yuzu peel on top. The most impressive thing for me is the broth. After having tried so many ramen store in Tokyo, it is probably the best broth for me so far. There is the scent of salt left in the mouth but it is not salty. However, after mixing truffle into the broth, it doesn\u2019t make that difference. So next time I would go for normal shio ramen or normal yuzu ramen. The price is affordable in terms of Michelin guide dish and as compared to the quality and satisfaction received.\n\nWaiting 1 hour is acceptable especially during this kind of weather.

Anyway, we were the first ones to enter the restaurant and ordered their most signature special soy sauce ramen. The first sip of the broth was incredibly soothing (after waiting in the cold rain for two hours, it was really comforting to drink). The presentation of the whole bowl was rich, and the various types of meat were outstanding. Adding the truffle sauce when the noodles were about 70-80% finished really elevated the flavor profile and made me want to continue eating. The egg was also delicious and flavorful. The only complaint I have is that the two meatballs felt unnecessary and didn\u0027t taste good in my opinion."",""I had the yuzu-flavored ramen. The broth is light but full of flavor!

The specialty bowls of course run out first.\n\nA list goes out at 830am or so, maybe earlier now, and you sign up in the next available opening (no picking a time). I posted a photo of what to do, which includes saying do not write more than one name. This confused us as other people were writing (1) or (2) beside their name so at first we thought only write one name and how many with your group.\nThat is not correct.\nEach person needs to write their name on each line, he is just saying that you can only write your own name - and each person needs to be there if you want a seating. No cheating and writing names for anyone else \uD83D\uDE4F\uD83C\uDFFD.\n\nWe were 46/47 for 12:45. You come at your time and line up on the side walk, nearest the street. We were the first ones there to wait and didn\u2019t know where to stand. Others walked in and got yelled at, do not walk in the store ever until you\u2019re invited in. Seriously though, especially if you\u2019re not Japanese. It\u2019s only for people eating and it\u2019s tiny.\nOnce you\u2019re invited in you will pay at the vending machine as usual and give him your order ticket. I shared a photo of the offerings current as of February. Just keep in mind to be prepared to eat faster than you\u2019re used to, people are waiting and you have a time slot. This one was easy for us as we\u2019ve been working hard to speed up our eating time, as we are still a few minutes slower than locals; at other places without the nice dedicated time slot it\u2019s more of a burden to others waiting to eat.\n\nFood:\nBest ramen of my life, and I\u2019m a tonkotsu lover. My wife agrees and in the video you can see her quietly whispering me \u201Cit\u2019s soo good\u201D. We are not ramen food critics by any means but we have had hundreds of bowls of ramen all over the world, as well as about 10 Michelin star recognized places now and this is hands down my favorite.\nThe variety of chashu, the thought that goes into the arrangement, the varied texture, fattiness and complexity is incredible. Some melts, some melds with each bite.\nWontons - possibly perfection as far as ramen wontons go\nFor me, the ingredients are just incredible.\n\nThe soup / base - Up there with the best I\u2019ve had, possibly my favorite. I thought it got better and better as it slightly cool\n\nThe noodles - we went with the hand rolled and thought they were quite good. Not my ideal noodle style or thickness but an 8/10 still.\n\nPork rice bowl was super good and left us overstuffed but while we had the opportunity, I had to get it.\n\nLoved getting to watch his workflow putting the bowls together, raise and drain the noodles.\n\nWhile a high hurdle to get a seat, and a bit stressful as a foreigner - it was such a pleasure to get to enjoy this."",""MAR 2024\n\nThere are 60 slots per day and I arrived 30 minutes before the reservation time which starts at 8:30AM. I managed to get a seat for 11:45AM. Ordering is via cash only from the ticket machine and there is self serve water. I had the special soy sauce ramen which had a few different cuts of pork slices, a half boiled egg and wonton dumplings. The soup has a deep and flavorsome soy sauce taste without being too salty, noodle was slightly on the softer side, both the lean and fatty cuts of pork were tender. Wonton and egg were tasty as well. The grilled pork with spring onion and egg yolk mini rice bowl was pretty good when you add in some of the ramen soup.
