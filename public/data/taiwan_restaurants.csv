I ordered a small bowl of beef noodle, and they fetched me a SUPER big bowl. I initially thought that they probably incorrectly gave me that. However, after ascertaining that with the waiter, it turned out that the size I ordered is truly the smaller one.\n\nThe size for their small bowl is as huge as normal big size bowl from most restaurants or eateries in Taiwan. Therefore, my suggestion is that for those have big appetite, you won\u2019t be regret to have a giant bowl from their store.\n\nAfter having the meal, it\u2019s also good to stroll a little for digestion until arrive at the MRT Zishan Station.\n\nDefinitely I strongly recommend those have big appetite to visit the store. 10 out of 10 I gave the store for their fantastic service and numerous materials they provide from their dishes."",""Service"",""Service"",""Dine in"",""Dine in"","""",""Meal type"",""Meal type"",""Lunch"",""Lunch"","""",""Price per person"",""Price per person"",""$200\u2013400"",""$200\u2013400"","""",""Food: 5"",""Food: 5"","""",""Service: 5"",""Service: 5"","""",""Atmosphere: 4"",""Atmosphere: 4"","""",""The soup is a bit too heavy for me, but is value and delicious.\nBig serve is good enough for 2 person.\nBeef is amazing and tender. \u2026"","" More"",""Zhongcheng beef noodles was so good, I got the small bowl and i left full, they give you huge chunks of beef.

This place is none other than Zhongcheng Beef Noodle Restaurant, a local favorite that has quietly withstood the test of time.\n\nWhat makes Zhongcheng so beloved is its broth, a carefully crafted blend of dark soy, tomato, and red chili. This is not just any broth - it\u0027s the result of a family recipe, passed down through generations, its secrets zealously guarded.\n\nThe stewards of this tradition are a pair of sisters who have been running the place for over 20 years. They\u0027ve made it their mission to provide good value to their customers, a promise they uphold with bowls that are generously filled, bucking the trend of smaller portions around the city.\n\nTheir noodles are thick and chewy, perfect for soaking up the flavorful broth. As for the beef, it comes in two forms: shanks and tendons. The tendons are juicy, with a pleasant gelatinous texture, while the shanks are tender and packed with flavor.\n\nThe beef noodle soup is often served with a side of tea eggs and seaweed, simple but classic accompaniments that round out the meal. And to complete the experience, you\u0027re encouraged to wash it all down with a crisp Apple Sidra soda.\n\nZhongcheng Beef Noodle Restaurant is a gem in Taipei\u0027s dining scene, a tribute to the enduring appeal of a well-loved dish. It\u0027s a place I always make a point of visiting whenever I\u0027m in town.

The \u2026"","" More"",""Nestled on the 86th floor within Taipei 101, this upscale buffet offers a luxurious dining experience complemented by stunning panoramic views. Reservations are a must, either made online or by phone. Upon arrival, guests are warmly welcomed at the reception desk on the first floor of Taipei 101 and promptly escorted to their reserved table by the attentive wait staff.\n\nArriving at 2:45pm during lunch hour, our brief wait for the wait staff to escort us to our reserved table lasted approximately 5-10 minutes, ensuring a smooth entry process. The restaurant\u0027s unique circular seating arrangement, positioned near the expansive glass windows, affords diners uninterrupted views of Taipei\u0027s skyline. Additionally, the circular layout of the food stations simplifies navigation, allowing guests to explore the diverse culinary offerings effortlessly.\n\nThe buffet presents an impressive array of dishes, showcasing a fusion of international cuisines to cater to diverse dietary preferences. Standout highlights include the tantalizing fire-grilled sushi, succulent freshly grilled steaks and pork ribs, and an assortment of meticulously crafted artisanal coffee and cocktails. Noteworthy is the chef\u0027s personalized attention at the steak and pork rib station, where each dish is expertly plated in French style, elevating the dining experience.\n\nReflecting on the meal, while the price-performance ratio may not be the highest due to the absence of standout premium ingredients, the buffet\u0027s emphasis on luxury dining justifies its price point. It remains a worthwhile culinary journey, particularly for discerning travelers seeking an indulgent experience in Taiwan. Priced at over 4,000 NTD per person, the restaurant\u0027s commitment to menu uniqueness and ingredient quality shines through.\n\nA thoughtful touch is the provision of postcards at each table, allowing guests to pen their sentiments on the spot and deposit them in a special mailbox. We were pleasantly surprised to receive our postcard a month later at our address in Madrid, Spain, a testament to the restaurant\u0027s dedication to guest satisfaction and attention to detail. Overall, the buffet at Taipei 101 offers an unforgettable dining experience that seamlessly blends luxury, gastronomy, and breathtaking views."",""Service"",""Service"",""Dine in"",""Dine in"","""",""Meal type"",""Meal type"",""Lunch"",""Lunch"","""",""Price per person"",""Price per person"",""$2,000\u002B"",""$2,000\u002B"","""",""Food: 4"",""Food: 4"","""",""Service: 5"",""Service: 5"","""",""Atmosphere: 5"",""Atmosphere: 5"","""",""Recommended dishes"",""Recommended dishes"",""\u806F\u540D\u751C\u9EDE, 101\u96DE\u86CB\u7CD5"",""\u806F\u540D\u751C\u9EDE, 101\u96DE\u86CB\u7CD5"","""","""",""Had dinner last night.

We all came back from living overseas (Europe and US), so my review might be different~\nAnyways, do I want to spend 5000 TWD on a buffet?? Maybe not? But this seems like a popular thing in Taiwan? Usually when I spend this kind of money, it\u0027s more for a nice restaurant ambiance! Anyways. Moving on...\n\nLots of food options but majority of the people were of course aiming for fresh seafood. We had quite a bit of sushi, sashimi and hand rolls, not bad. But again, we had to queue... So again, is this the experience you want?! I\u0027m not sure.\n\nYou can see from my photos the ambiance is nice, view is great so id say it\u0027s nice to go there for the experience. Food wise, for me personally, western food is ok, I personally go for more local taiwanese cuisines but then again you can get them anywhere as well.\n\nI will say that they did care about little details like plating~ a few more unusual buffet items you wouldn\u0027t get in Taiwan (some salads).

It\u0027s tasty and varied, although you can\u0027t expect any dish to stand out like in a specialized restaurant--it\u0027s a buffet, after all. However, the experience is well worth it for the stunning views \u2026"","" More"",""My recent visit to A Joy in Taipei offered a mix of exceptional and disappointing experiences. The food and the view of Taipei 101 were undoubtedly the highlights of the day, justifying the high price of 3680 TWD per person. The dishes were creatively crafted, combining fresh ingredients with innovative culinary techniques, and the stunning view of the city skyline added a special charm to the meal.\n\nHowever, the service and facilities fell short of expectations. Firstly, while I was in the restroom, my friend was rushed to pay the bill twice within a span of less than 10 minutes, despite having informed the staff that I would be handling the payment. This created an uncomfortable and rushed dining experience, which was not in line with the standard expected at such a premium establishment.\n\nSecondly, the restroom facilities were inadequate. With only three stalls available in the men\u0027s restroom, I had to wait for an extended period of time. Surprisingly, one of the stalls was occupied by a staff member, raising concerns about staff using the same facilities during work hours, especially when customer demand is high. For a high-end buffet charging over 3000 TWD, the restroom facilities were not only insufficient but also paled in comparison to much less expensive establishments.\n\nIn summary, while A Joy excels in culinary expertise and offers a mesmerizing view, the service approach and restroom facilities significantly dampened the overall experience. I hope this feedback helps in improving these aspects for future diners."",""Service"",""Service"",""Dine in"",""Dine in"","""",""Meal type"",""Meal type"",""Lunch"",""Lunch"","""",""Price per person"",""Price per person"",""$2,000\u002B"",""$2,000\u002B"","""",""Food: 4"",""Food: 4"","""",""Service: 1"",""Service: 1"","""",""Atmosphere: 4"",""Atmosphere: 4"","""","" More""]","The buffet at Taipei 101 is amazing!
