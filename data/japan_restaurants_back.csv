So much that my friend and I ate there 3 times in 4 days! The soufflé pancakes here were much better than the happy pancakes place, in my opinion.\n\nMy friend and I tried different dishes from here.

I also tried the Tom yum soup with noodles and that was light and comforting. We didn’t like the garlic shrimp pasta very much.\n\nAvocado salad was great. Also enjoyed the buttermilk fried chicken!

Amazing service too; very nice waiters and they made slight adjustments to my dishes when I asked. Food was also very affordable."",""***how to find!***\nGoogle maps is really bad at telling you how to find this place! You need to go into the electronics store and find the elevator to the 8th floor!\n\nVery good restaurant! Really nice ambiance, and great decor. The staff is really nice, and the middle long table is great for meeting people!\n\nI had the eggs Benedict with a Chiffon Cake! The eggs were really fresh, and tasted home made! The sauces used were really tasty, and the presentation was amazing! My only complaint was a bit too much salt on the fries.\n\nThe chiffon cake was extremely soft and sweet!

They were indeed fluffy but I would go back only for the French toast even though it seems like the hot cakes are their selling point.\n\nService was fast and English friendly. In a very busy area in a busy mall but worthwhile if not a long wait. Luckily, no wait when I went on Friday lunchtime.\n\nRecommend if in the area!"",""Popping in looking for French toast and we were not let down with it. The wait is long for it since it is baked and prepared fresh but the flavor is great. The Eggs Benedict was also good on flavor the picture from the online menu do not depict much American cheese on then I didn’t notice any on the photos and I don’t generally have cheese all over mine the flavor was still good but would skip that item next time. The grapefruit juice as well is one of my favorites and always order it when it’s at restaurant and isn’t as common these days."",""Good food and portions for the price. The service was okay. The place seems to fill up very quickly. However, the entire restaurant felt like it needed a face lift. As the tables and chairs were at the end of their life cycle. The floors and walls were dirty too covered in sauce stains and scraps it seems. Obviously this place is popular with tourists and accessible, so I can't knock it too hard, but this rating is definitely closer to a 3 than a 4."",""Was so good we came here twice. Had the Eggs Benedict followed by the Macadamia Pancakes because I just couldn’t make up my mind. Both were delicious. Husband had the same but with the Creme Brûlée pancakes and they were ok\n\nTried the Beef Pho when we came back the second time and it was better than the pho I had at other places although I could have done with more rice noodles. Plenty of veggies and herbs in there though."",""I went in the morning and there was a 1 hour+ wait, I came back at night and there was no wait! I ordered the original french toast, pancakes, and garlic shrimp pasta. The French toast portion is a bit small, but tasted better than the pancakes as the pancakes tasted too buttery even when I didn’t add any butter.

Very impressed by the excellent quality of the beef tendered and not too greasy at all - it is a tradition to dip into whisked egg as good pairing.\n\nNothing to complain at all just the price is on the upper bar in its exquisite service."",""Been here many times especially when visit Tokyo. Best sukiyaki ever. A little bit pricey but worth every penny and deserves michelin star. They have specific requirements for meat, vegetables, fruits, anything. So they will serve you best food on the table.\nService was great, they are very polite and attentive. Mrs. Aoyama was very helpful, kind, and care to us.

Otherwise just a very exquisite experience."",""Came to enjoy sukiyaki with co-workers. Everything was amazing. From the traditional service to the amazing food. The beef just melted in my mouth and the coating of raw egg made it velvety and creamy. The veggies, which were picked during to being in season, was a great pairing to the meat. The last course of rice with lightly cooked eggs was elevated when the waitress told us to pour the remaining raw egg into the rice.

The slightly unusual dishes, such as bamboo shoot namul and cherry tomato kimchi, are delicious.\n\n``Hiraku Salad'' is simple, but the dressing is delicious. I want to eat meat while picking to cleanse my palate, so I'd be happy if there was a little more.\n\nNow it's time for the meat! This one, named ``meat appetizer,'' is a large piece of beef sashimi with a heaping amount of yukhoe covered in sweet sauce in the center. An outrageous act of eating yukhoe mixed with egg yolk wrapped in beef sashimi! I'm sure it's delicious.\n\nNext up is two types of tongue: ``Extremely Thick Sliced ​​Tongue'' and ``Devil's Tongue.'' The thick slices can be cut in half and grilled in two ways: well-grilled or rare, and the thinly sliced ​​``Devil's Tongue'' can be grilled quickly. All have different textures and are delicious! Personally, I like thinly sliced ​​meat.\n\nFor ``Japanese Grilled Wagyu Sushi,'' only the sushi rice is brought to you, and then the staff quickly grills the thinly sliced ​​Wagyu beef in front of you and places it on the sushi rice. Pop it into your mouth as soon as you can! The meat melts in your mouth.\n\nThe ``Assortment of 4 types of carefully selected meat'' includes tomosankaku, rump, chili pepper, and shoulder loin, ranging from lean meat to marbled meat. When you eat these with salt, it brings out the flavor of the meat, allowing you to enjoy the flavor of the red meat and fat.\n\nWhite rice here. The rice is also cooked in a clay pot, so it's fluffy and juicy. Shiny and sweet.\n\nI was asked to grill the \""thick-sliced ​​special liver\"" properly (in Ostrich Club style), so I wondered if the liver was ever so soft, fluffy, and delicious.\n\nThe ``Large-sized Specially Selected Misuji Sukiyaki'' is also grilled by the staff in front of you, mixed with orange egg yolk, and served with rice cooked in a clay pot for a truly delicious meal.\n\nThe last dish is ``Kiwami Ichibo and Tokusho Harami.'' This is sauce-based, and there are two types: lean meat and marbled meat, so it's nice to be able to compare the deliciousness of the meat while eating it. As an old man, I don't like greasy foods anymore, so I guess I prefer skirt steak. I want to keep carbohydrates to a minimum at night, but I always end up eating white rice!\n\nTo finish off your meal, choose a dessert from ``rich pudding,'' ``crème brûlée,'' or ``warabi mochi (or so I think?)''. I chose the ``rich pudding,'' and since I used the orange egg yolk I'd been eating earlier, it had a really strong flavor. The smooth and slightly firm pudding has a nostalgic feel, but is also very elegant."",""I visited a Yakiniku restaurant in Shibuya\uD83D\uDE97³₃\n\nThere was a shop in a good location, 5 minutes walk from Shibuya station \uD83D\uDE83\n\nWhen I searched for all-you-can-eat Kuroge Wagyu beef yakiniku on Instagram, I found Hiraku Yakiniku, so I made a reservation and visited \uD83D\uDE46‍♀️\n\nI visited here for lunch on a weekday, and there aren't many places where you can eat all-you-can-eat Kuroge Wagyu beef yakiniku for lunch on weekdays, so I highly recommend it for those who want to have all-you-can-eat yakiniku from lunch.\n\nFirst, you can enjoy the all-you-can-eat menu after receiving the rare cuts of loin, short ribs, and skirt steak☺️\n\nYou can choose salt sauce, but order with sauce\uD80C\uDF09\uD80C\uDDCB ‎\uD83E\uDD69\n\nThe sauce was delicious, but I wanted salt, so I ordered the additional meat with salt \uD83D\uDE0D\n\nBoth the sauce and salt are delicious ☺️\n\nSalt is recommended for those who want a light meal \uD83E\uDDC2\n\nWe carefully select high-quality A5-ranked meat, so is it really okay to eat as much as you want?

In that case, you can eat at the outdoor tables. They offer some French sweets here, like cannelés, but especially cream puffs. These are large puffs, generously filled with delicious vanilla cream. It's a bit pricey, close to 800 yen, but it was so good! I wish I could find ones like that in France."",""I seldom give 5 star rating but this pastry totally deserve it! Cream puff is full of fillings, you can see vanilla seeds and smell the fragrance.

The quality and seasoning of sushi is extraordinarily amazing, and with most seats facing the chef making sushi, it has no differences even compared to many omakase experiences.\n\nHave visited twice and each time we enjoyed every bite of it. I’m a fan of shrimps and scallops while my girlfriend loves salmon belly and chu-toro. We are both satisfied for what we are offered over the counter! Incredibly fresh and tasty, it gives us taste beyond all previous impressions. I will strongly recommend 赤えび、ホタテ、車えび which are definitely fascinating. Not gonna lie but we actually took 50 dishes, gonna cancel our eating plans for the next 24 hours lolllll.\n\nI’d also like to recommend the Chef’s choice three pieces. It costs only ¥1300 but serves as a delicious mystery box which you would not know until dish is in front of you. It’s a good choice to try those you wouldn’t risk to directly order, but will eventually broaden your choices. The two of us ordered 5 times of this mystery box, and it came out fascinating every single time.\n\nThe best time to come is from before it opens to 12:30 on weekdays, when there will not be a waiting line. Going for a dinner might be risky as the line is long and would take extra long time. It does offer the choice to notify through phone calls but not sure if foreign phone numbers would work."",""We were craving sushi while shopping around Omotesando/Aoyama, so we decided to swing by. The line was out the door, so we hopped onto the virtual queue. We finally got seated after waiting nearly an hour, but it was totally worth it. We got seated in a back room away from the main dining hall, so it was more private and omakase style, instead of the conveyor belt sushi we were hoping for. Despite that, the sushi prepared was extremely fresh and high quality, and the menu had a large and varied selection. Halfway through our seating, one of the chefs carried in a whole amberjack fish on his shoulder. All diners at the time had the option to guess its weight, and the closest ones were able to get a free sushi of fresh amberjack. We got lucky and were rewarded 1 piece each.\n\nReally had a great experience, and would highly recommend if you’re looking for a solid sushi spot. However, minus 1 star for the excessive wait time and slightly disordered queuing guidelines and process"",""Social media hype. This got to be the worse sushi I've ever had at any price range. The fish has so much tendon, I felt like I was chewing on a plastic bag. Rice was not cooked also. Everything felt extremely not fresh. I had better fish from local supermarkets. The seating was not comfortable and very cramped. Most customers were foreigners. All I see ppl busy posting on instagram. Save yourself some money and go to any local sushi restaurant and you'll have better quality food at the lower price and more comfortable atmosphere."",""Extremely fresh seafood and tasty sushi served in Tokyo. This sushi restaurant was known for the Michelin Star which was given to the Ginza shop and it is very well known by the locals.

We found Onodera Namiki Dori after some research. It's the newer of two branches in Ginza. Located on the 6th floor of an unassuming building, once you go in, you're greeted with a very high end traditional Japanese setting. It's a small venue that can maybe sit max 10 to 12 customers.\n\nWe opted for dinner which is an omakase course. We also booked early (they open at 6pm for dinner service) and were very lucky to have the restaurant to ourselves for the first hour before the next guest arrived. This made it a truly memorable experience for us.\n\nSuzuki-san, the head chef, was an absolute delight, taking the time to explain each dish and engage in small talk while effortlessly preparing and making each dish.\n\nThe quality and execution of each was immaculate. Even though many of the dishes were deep fried, we didn't feel as heavy by the end as one would think.\n\nWould highly recommend this restaurant if you're looking for high end tempura. Yes, it's pricey but worth the experience as you'll walk out having tried the best possible versions of tempura classics like prawn, mushrooms, eggplant but will have also tried tempura you'd likely never have before, ranging from unique fishes we had never had before to uni being wrapped in shiso and fried.\n\nYou'll need to book in advance and can do so online. Suzuki-san and his team all speak some English, which is great.\n\nAlso worth mentioning that the last dish before dessert was a true highlight, you get to pick how you want your kakiage. Believe there were 4 or 5 choices ranging from having it as a rice set to being set on top of soba noodles. We opted for ochazuke (rice with a tea-based dashi broth) which was sublime!"",""Had an absolutely wonderful experience here. I recommend making reservations due to limited seating and timeslots.\n\nManager and Sommelier Yuki Inoue was very friendly and informative (Spoke English). He helped suggest a few sake pairings that went well with the tempura omakase lineup.\n\nExecutive Chef Yuya Uchi and his team were exceptionally coordinated and did an excellent job delivering delicious tempura and informing us on how it should be eaten. The food was exceptional. The batter was light, hot, and crispy. The ingredients were fresh or prepared with care.\n\nMy wife and I could've kept to ourselves, and dinner would've been great, but we chose to engage with the staff, and our experience here was elevated. I would suggest that you also choose to engage with wonder and an open mind.\n\nI would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for a fantastic and unique experience!"",""Wonderful dining experience with incredible tempura. The staff and chef were so friendly with my wife and our 3 children and they all had an incredible experience. We would recommend this to anyone coming to Tokyo. The tofu tempura and mushroom tempura were favorites. Thank you again!"",""Definitely one of the best tempura place in town.

To be honest, I hardly find any good restaurant in KL that serves good unagi due to the fact that most of them use local variety that has muddy taste in it. Since I was heading to Shibuya one evening, I found one in Unagi Toku located in the famous Shibuya Hikarie building, a few minutes walk from the Shibuya station.\n\nIt was still quite early for dinner so the restaurant was quite empty. Famis\n\nI had to say that so far this is the best unagi I'd tasted in my life (read my life.. not yours). Famished but didn't want to stuff our stomach too much, we settled for one of their signature dishes and one basic dish.\n◾Unagi Chazuke Tokujyou - costing 5200 yen, this set was meticulously prepared and beautifully presented in front of us. The grilled unagi was served together with the rice in wooden bucket. The instructions clearly stated that to enjoy the dish we must (1) taste the original taste of unagi first; (2) pair the unagi with shallot and wasabi, and lastly (3) pour the homemade tea into the rice bowl containing the unagi, shallot and wasabi and eat it Ochazuke style.\n◾Shirayaki Gohan - simple lightly grilled unagi on rice with Japanese pickles and soup. Oh my god I simply love this as I could definitely taste the original flavour of the unagi without any marinade or flavouring. Just dip the unagi into their soy sauce and eat just like that.\n\nThe unagi was very tender and the sauce (from the set) tasted just right - not too sweet nor salty - price-wise just remember that this is Tokyo. Another food checked from my list."",""Not the best hitsumabushi but definitely not the worst either (I'm a bit biased with Nagoya style of unagi). Keep in mind that it's on the expensive side. What I enjoyed here was the fluffy and juicy umaki (eel rolled omelette). Ambiance is good and service was exceptional. I will still come and dine here for the umaki and probably try other stuff on their menu.\n\nFoodibear gives Unagi Toku a decent 4/5."",""No waiting time. Staff was friendly and approachable.

I never looked at the menu because it didn't look very appetizing.\n\nWhen I was having lunch at around 12:30 after the meeting, I was tired and wanted to eat pork cutlet nearby, and I wanted to eat some more at a nearby Starbucks on the way home, so I decided to go there.\n\nHmm, the menu is generally priced at over 2,000 yen. After thinking about it, I ordered a 3-piece set for 2,300 yen, which included fried shrimp, minced meat, and pork cutlet. For the rice, you can choose between white rice or green shiso, so I decided to go with blue shiso.\n\nThere was a long wait, maybe because of the tonkatsu dish, or maybe because it was crowded. Despite that, the shrimp fries were thin, the tonkatsu batter peeled off...I was expecting rice, but there was almost no flavor...which was quite disappointing. The only thing that was delicious was the nameko soup with red soup stock. If I'm going to pay 2,300 yen for this, I wonder if I'll eat something else in Ginza.

I'm also curious about the taco rice.\nI was also happy that they gave me a huge discount ticket for 300 yen off the set meal, although the expiration date was short. Will you give it to me every time?\nThat's an incredible service!\nIt's within walking distance and I plan to visit next week."",""It's a small restaurant with a capacity of about 10 people, so it gets quite crowded during lunch. I had the loin cutlet lunch for 800 yen, and it also came with a small side dish and pickles, so it was a decent meal. The miso soup had a bit of a strong taste, but it had a lot of ingredients in it. It might be better to have a large serving of rice. The white rice is shiny and delicious! The taste of the tonkatsu is delicious, but the coating tends to peel off easily, so I have no choice but to eat it in one bite. The lady running the store is also very nice, so it's no wonder it's such a popular store. Regarding the menu of pork cutlet restaurants, there are quite a few restaurants that serve ``Champon''. It seems to be a popular menu item at this restaurant. The Champon from the pork cutlet shop is delicious."",""I went there for Champon, but since I couldn't find it on the Friday lunch menu, I had the most popular thick-sliced ​​top loin cutlet. The batter was thin and the meat wasn't as tender as I expected.\nIt would have been better to have the special loin cutlet.\nTaco rice has a large amount of rice.\nThe accompanying salad was better with lettuce instead of cabbage...\nWhat bothered me was that the soup was salty.\nIs it overcooked?\nThe restaurant is a little bit off the road so it's hard to find, but the interior was clean and I was able to eat in a relaxed atmosphere.\nYou will have to park at a nearby coin parking lot, but it will fill up depending on the timing.\nI would like to go eat Champon someday as revenge."",""As with any store, if you go when it's busy, you tend to get a bad evaluation of the service that you can see.\nThis time, it seemed like they were processing orders from inside the store at the same time as customers who had ordered dozens of bento boxes for takeout, so the wait time was quite long.\nAs a result, the thick-sliced ​​pork cutlet that was ordered and served was hard and not good. My clothes are also peeling off.\nI want to support them somehow, so next time I'd like to go when it's not busy."",""Probably my favorite tonkatsu✨\n\nThe batter is crispy, but the meat is moist and soft and the fat is delicious.\nIt's delicious whether you eat it with wasabi salt, yuzu salt, or sauce, and the rest is your choice.\nIt was delicious even without adding anything♪\n\nI’m also happy that you get a free refill of rice \uD83D\uDE0A\n\n・Special loin cutlet set meal 1,430 yen (dinner)"",""Visited for lunch.\nThere is a sign outside saying that we have started serving cutlet curry!\nIt was my first visit to a tonkatsu restaurant and I was wondering what cutlet …"",""I ordered the top loin cutlet,\nThe oil was not drained well and the back of the cutlet was sticky with oil.\nBecause of that, it didn't taste delicious at all.

All menus are very appealing and not the kind of menus you can find anywhere else (I am pretty decisive when it comes to menus, but it takes 20 minutes for me to decide, everything looks good and exciting that I want to try).\n\nI ordered French Toast with Salad (add: melted cheese). The bread and cheese tasted so good; the bread texture was \""mochi-mochi,\"" I am pretty sure they are using premium bread, and the cheese was also decent. They add one stick of basil, so we can sprinkle it on our own, as much as we want. It was delicious and fulfilling compared to another brunch; I was not hungry until the evening.\n\nI am a big café latte fan, so I ordered a café latte, and my friend ordered a matcha latte. The drinks are very aesthetic; and for the taste, it tastes the same as other coffee.\nOnly cold drinks are available for this type of drink because the staff said they need ice cube to make the gradation.\n\nI ordered a long millefeuille Easter edition for dessert because it was adorable!! But this type of food takes much work to eat. Once you cut the pie, the crumble is scattered everywhere, and the taste is not what I expected.\n\nPrepare your card because they do not accept cash, and be patient because this place is so famous that you must line up. Not only among the locals but it is also famous among tourists.\nA small and pretty store with new menu ideas, it is worth trying occasionally."",""Let's start with the hard part: a tiny restaurant located on the 2nd floor of a building whose only exterior detail is an Irish pub. Their signage is practically nonexistent.\n\nThat aside, we stumbled into this place while searching for brunch the other day and, after some apprehension caused by climbing an old, nondescript stairway to open a blank door, were greeted by a cozy, busy, and very lively grill, with bar seating and a few tables. The place is tight, but the lack of signage seems to leave a few spots open for opportunistic eaters.\n\nWhat can I say about the menu, but that it's fun? The dishes are unique and interesting (if predictably Japanese-brunch; see thick toast and uncrisped bacon) with clear thought put into the presentation. The food was fantastic, and it was a pleasure to watch the cooks working away at the grill on the other side of the bar.\n\nAll in all, I'm glad I found this place, especially since it seems to do all it can to hide, and I will be returning."",""No store sign outside of the building so it took awhile to find. The cafe entrance is on the the 2nd floor, no sign either. The interior is not spacious but comfortable and beautifully design. You will be asked to look at the menu online and they will take your order and pay at at the corner of the cafe, not at your table once you decide what you want. I think that might be due to the space being tight.\n\nThe overall presentation of the food is nicely done with beautiful color, two different kinds of hard boiled eggs served in egg holders, coffee served in a tall wine style glass gives a nice sophisticated touch. Food tasted good too. White toast is the base for meal and deserts."",""Amazing little open kitchen feel with bar seating (in front of kitchen) or communal table.  Can’t make reservations but I went in on a Sunday morning and waited no more than 5 min.  The food was artisanal and the drinks are very nicely made. Very surprisingly nice and huge scoop passion fruit sorbet on the rim of the cold brew coffee.  Had the egg white omelette and kale salad on cheese crepe.  All very good."",""The food was really good! I like the layout and ambience of the place as well.
